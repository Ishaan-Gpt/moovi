# Claude Code bridge: handoff

Read this first if you are picking the work up. Updated by Tab after every item.

- **Goal:** users on the Moovi website with no API key connect their Claude Code; per video they type `/moovi:run` and
  Claude Code makes only the top-level decisions (1 to 3 calls per video); Moovi's server does everything else.
- **Plan:** `docs/agents/research/mcp-claude-code-bridge-plan.md` (sections 16 to 23 win over earlier ones).
- **Checklist:** `CHECKLIST.md` (this folder). **Log:** `LOG.md`.
- **Branch:** `vignesh/mcp-sampling` (work), merged to `main` with `--no-ff` after each green item.
- **Last sha:** see the newest line in `LOG.md`.
- **Current state:** plan done; items 1, 2 and 6 done. No product code yet.
- **Next item:** 3 (freeze the "direct the edit" JSON shape).

## How to run things

- Engine tests: `cd packages/engine && npx tsx --test test/*.test.ts` (FalkorDB tests skip without `FALKORDB_URL`).
- Typecheck one package at a time: `cd packages/<pkg> && npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit`
  (`pnpm -r typecheck` fails in a non-interactive shell).
- Bridge tests (from phase 1): `cd packages/mcp && npx tsx --test test/*.test.ts`.
- FalkorDB/Redis for queue tests: `FALKORDB_URL=falkor://127.0.0.1:6394` on Tab's box; elsewhere run the repo's
  `pnpm falkordb` (docker) and use port 6380.

## Rules

- Commits: author `VIGNESH B S <vigneshbs33@gmail.com>`, no em or en dashes in docs or messages, secret scan before push.
- Never commit node_modules, media, binaries, `runenv.json`, `rt/cache/clips-*.json`, `_*.ts`.
- Owner map (STAGE-1.md): Tab owns `chat.ts`, `router/`, `edit/`, `review/`, `keys.ts`, `worker.ts`, `runtime/`,
  `packages/mcp`. Ishaan's sessions own `styles/`, `packages/library/src/kits/`, `apps/`, `packages/brand`,
  `packages/character`. A change in someone else's area goes through their log first.
- Anthropic terms: per job, user triggered only (`/moovi:run`). No background loop, no `claude -p` daemon.

## Open questions

1. `edit/job.ts` hook for the direction (style, cleanup, moves, cards): Tab's area per STAGE-1, but Ishaan's final
   merge changed it; note in his log before editing.
2. Creative mode doing more per stage (STAGE-1 W3) vs few calls (Vignesh 7:34 PM): proposal is to fold it into the one
   "direct" call (e.g. write and rank hooks inside it).
3. SERVER-LLM stages need Moovi's own server key (a cheap fast model). Which provider and budget?

## Gotchas

- Claude Code HTTP tool calls: first byte within 60 s, abort after 5 min idle without progress. Long poll 45 s max.
- Claude Code warns past 10k tokens of tool output; keep every step small.
- The engine's own deadlines assume an API; the bridge scope sets `deadlineScale` high and the bridge enforces its own
  pickup and answer timeouts.
- `review/config.ts` caps the vision timeout at 120 s; scale it by `deadlineScale()` (one line).
- Claude Code cannot see which model it runs to us; the answer schema carries a self-reported `model` field.
