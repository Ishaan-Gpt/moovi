# Claude Code bridge: handoff

> **Live progress is on branch `claude-code-bridge`:** https://github.com/Ishaan-Gpt/moovi/tree/claude-code-bridge/docs/agents/claude-code-bridge (this copy on main is a snapshot; the branch is updated after every item).

Read this first if you are picking the work up. Updated by Tab after every item.

- **Goal:** users on the Moovi website with no API key connect their Claude Code; per video they type `/moovi:run` and
  Claude Code makes only the top-level decisions (1 to 3 calls per video); Moovi's server does everything else.
- **Plan:** `docs/agents/research/mcp-claude-code-bridge-plan.md` (sections 16 to 23 win over earlier ones).
- **Checklist:** `CHECKLIST.md` (this folder). **Log:** `LOG.md`.
- **Branch:** `claude-code-bridge`. Before every item: `git fetch` and merge `origin/main` into it (additive merge
  commit, Ishaan's shas in LOG.md). After every green item (tsc per package, full engine suite, secret scan): push the
  branch, then merge it into `main` with an additive merge commit and push main too (Vignesh 2026-10-17 19:52 IST: "keep
  pushing in main as well as in this new branch"; matches Ishaan's CLAUDE.md). Red code goes to the branch only.
- **Push:** through the GitHub API (git data: blobs, trees, commits, then the ref with `force: false`), never force.
- **Last sha:** see the newest line in `LOG.md`.
- **Current state:** Phase 0 done; Phase 1 items 7, 8, 9 done. See the newest LOG lines for shas.
  - Contracts: `engine/src/edit/direct.schema.ts`, `engine/src/router/direct-film.schema.ts`, `engine/src/runtime/budget.ts`.
  - Lane switch: `engine/src/runtime/lane.ts` (brain calls to Claude Code online, else key, else server under
    MOOVI_BYOK=optional, else wait; detail calls never reach Claude Code); `keys.registerBrainScope`, `keys.serverModel`.
  - `packages/mcp`: `store.ts` (memory or FalkorDB Redis side, keys `ce:brain:*`), `queue.ts` (`StepQueue`, memo 24 h,
    exactly-once pick key), `bridge.ts` (`bridgeRuntime`), `lease.ts` (`Gate`: `mintTicket`, `pull(user, session,
    ticket)` = moovi_next, `submit(user, session, lease, step, answer)` = moovi_answer; idle texts are the exact words
    Claude Code will show).
  - Needed later: `chat.ts` line 20 checks `loadModel` under MOOVI_BYOK=required; switch it to `scopeFor(cmd.user)`.
- **Next item:** 10 (answer checker: strict JSON against the step's schema via `readDirection`/`readFilmDirection`, one re-ask with the
  exact problems as `history`, then the safe default (the rules) with a "default used" note; wire it as the bridge's
  `accept` hook so only accepted answers are remembered).

## How to run things

- Engine tests: `cd packages/engine && npx tsx --test test/*.test.ts` (FalkorDB tests skip without `FALKORDB_URL`).
- Typecheck one package at a time: `cd packages/<pkg> && npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit`
  (`pnpm -r typecheck` fails in a non-interactive shell).
- Bridge tests (from phase 1): `cd packages/mcp && npx tsx --test test/*.test.ts`.
- FalkorDB/Redis for queue tests: `FALKORDB_URL=falkor://127.0.0.1:6394` on Tab's box; elsewhere run the repo's
  `pnpm falkordb` (docker) and use port 6380.

## Rules

- Commits: author `VIGNESH B S <vigneshbs33@gmail.com>`, no em or en dashes in docs or messages, secret scan before push.
- Never commit node_modules, media, binaries, `runenv.json`, `rt/cache/clips-*.json`, `_*.ts`.
- Owner map (STAGE-1.md): Tab owns `chat.ts`, `router/`, `edit/`, `review/`, `keys.ts`, `worker.ts`, `runtime/`,
  `packages/mcp`. Ishaan's sessions own `styles/`, `packages/library/src/kits/`, `apps/`, `packages/brand`,
  `packages/character`. A change in someone else's area goes through their log first.
- Anthropic terms: per job, user triggered only (`/moovi:run`). No background loop, no `claude -p` daemon.

## Open questions

1. `edit/job.ts` hook for the direction (style, cleanup, moves, cards): Tab's area per STAGE-1, but Ishaan's final
   merge changed it; note in his log before editing.
2. Creative mode doing more per stage (STAGE-1 W3) vs few calls (Vignesh 7:34 PM): proposal is to fold it into the one
   "direct" call (e.g. write and rank hooks inside it).
3. SERVER-LLM stages need Moovi's own server key (a cheap fast model). Which provider and budget?

## Gotchas

- Claude Code HTTP tool calls: first byte within 60 s, abort after 5 min idle without progress. Long poll 45 s max.
- Claude Code warns past 10k tokens of tool output; keep every step small.
- The engine's own deadlines assume an API; the bridge scope sets `deadlineScale` high and the bridge enforces its own
  pickup and answer timeouts.
- `review/config.ts` caps the vision timeout at 120 s; scale it by `deadlineScale()` (one line).
- Claude Code cannot see which model it runs to us; the answer schema carries a self-reported `model` field.
